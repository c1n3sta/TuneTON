Concept of a Music Streaming Player with Personalized On-the-Fly Track Editing

General Description:
An innovative music streaming player enabling listeners to modify popular tracks live according to their personal preferences. The platform combines a rich music library with modern audio effects, providing a unique experience of customizing compositions during playback.

1. Key Platform Features
Licensed Track Streaming:
Access to an extensive library of popular music with high-quality audio.

Real-Time Track Editing:
Users can apply these effects during playback:

Tempo slow-down/speed-up (Pitch & Tempo shift)

Lo-fi mode with special presets simulating vinyl, cassette, radio, "dirty" filters, etc.

Equalizer for manual adjustment of low, mid, and high frequencies

Cut/remix: cutting pieces, looping, adding reverb, changing track structure

Crossfade between effects

Vocal/instrument removal or emphasis via AI STEM separation

Saving and Sharing Presets:
Users can save custom track settings and share them with friends or communities via links or QR codes.

2. Personalization and Social Features
Personal Audio Profile:
Users create unique sound "styles" applied to all chosen tracks (e.g., consistently pitch shifted up a half tone plus slight vinyl crackle).

Interactive Playlists:
Build playlists from both original and modified track versions.

Social Challenges:
Prizes for the most popular or unusual customizations, contests for best lo-fi remix, etc.

3. UX/UI Features
Visual Editor:
Simple sliders, presets, and circular controls beneath the player.

Audio Effect Visualization:
Spectrum changes when toggling Lo-fi/Hi-Fi modes, tape animation during cassette mode.

Platform Integration:
Desktop and mobile apps integrated with social networks and messengers for sharing custom track versions.

4. Technology Base
AI and Machine Learning:
Used for STEM separation, beat detection, and personalized recommendations based on user customizations.

High-Performance Audio Engine:
Built with modern frameworks like WebAudio API, JUCE, and Protobuf for transmitting processed audio data.

Legal Transparency:
User modifications do not violate copyrights as only information about applied settings is shared, not the processed files (or processed via DSP).

5. Additional Features
Background noises (rain, café, etc.) for immersive listening

Automation of effects based on time-codes during track playback

Support for cross-platform sessions to continue custom listening on any device

DJ mode integration for smooth track transitions while preserving custom effects

This service occupies a niche between classic streaming and beatmaker/jam communities, letting every listener feel like a sound engineer without complex DAWs or technical expertise.

TON Blockchain and Telegram Integration
TON Blockchain Integration:
Built on TON (The Open Network), a scalable, fast decentralized blockchain developed by the Telegram team, providing high transaction throughput and data security.

Telegram Bot / Mini-App:
Accessible inside Telegram as an embedded app, enabling millions of messenger users to use the player without installing separate software.

Royalty Distribution via Toncoin:
Artist and rights holder payments automated by smart contracts on TON, enabling transparent and precise royalty distribution in Toncoin, reducing intermediaries and accelerating payouts.

User Rewards and Prizes:
Participants in remix contests and social activities earn Toncoin rewards, boosting community engagement.

Decentralized Content Storage:
TON Storage and other TON services ensure protection of original content and user edits, respecting author rights.

NFT Ecosystem:
Create, sell, and trade unique audio presets and customized track versions as NFTs within the TON environment.

The player thus becomes part of a decentralized music ecosystem with transparent monetization and active community interaction inside Telegram and the TON blockchain, providing unique opportunities for artists and listeners utilizing advanced TON technology and Telegram's revolutionary platform.
