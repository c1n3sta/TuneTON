I've successfully set up the core functionality of the TuneTON audio player with a clean, modular architecture. Here's a summary of what's been implemented:

The development server is now up and running. Here's a quick recap of what we've accomplished and the next steps:

What's Working:
Project Structure: Set up a clean, modular structure for the TuneTON music player.
Core Audio Engine: Implemented a Web Audio API-based audio engine with:
Playback controls (play, pause, stop, seek)
Volume control and mute
Basic EQ with low/mid/high bands
Playback rate adjustment
React Components:
AudioPlayer
 component with a clean, responsive UI
Integration with the audio engine via a custom hook
Support for Telegram WebApp theming
Development Environment:
Set up Vite with React and TypeScript
Configured proper TypeScript support for CSS modules
Fixed package.json issues that were preventing the dev server from starting


've created a comprehensive 
.gitignore
 file that includes the .windsurf directory along with other common exclusions for a React/TypeScript project. Here's what's included:

Node.js specific:
node_modules/
npm-debug.log*
.pnp and .pnp.js
Build outputs:
/build
/dist
Environment files:
.env
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local
Editor specific:
.idea/ (WebStorm/IntelliJ)
.vscode/ (VS Code)
Various editor files (*.suo, *.ntvs*, etc.)
Windsurf configuration:
.windsurf/ (as requested)
Vite specific:
.vite/
*.local

've successfully fixed the pitch slider functionality in the audio player. Here's what was done:

Changes Made:
WebAudioEngine Class:
Implemented the missing 
setPitch
 method
Updated 
setPlaybackRate
 to consider both playback rate and pitch
Modified the 
play
 method to apply the initial pitch
AudioPlayer Component:
Fixed the pitch slider's onChange handler to properly handle the event
Added proper TypeScript types for the event handler
Added input validation for the pitch value
Type Safety:
Ensured proper type checking for all audio-related functions
Added null checks where necessary
How to Test:
Play the audio track
Use the pitch slider to adjust the pitch (range: 0.5x to 2.0x)
The pitch should now change in real-time as you move the slider
The playback rate and pitch adjustments should work together
Notes:
The pitch is adjusted by changing the playback rate, which affects both speed and pitch
For independent pitch and tempo control, we would need to implement a more advanced audio processing solution (like a pitch shifter algorithm)


've reorganized the metadata extraction into a dedicated microservice. Here's what I've done:

Created a new 
AudioMetadataExtractor
 service in 
src/core/metadata/AudioMetadataExtractor.ts
 that handles:
Extracting metadata from different source types (ArrayBuffer, URL, File)
Basic filename parsing (format: "Artist - Title")
Clean filename utilities
Updated 
AudioEngine.ts
 to:
Use the new 
AudioMetadataExtractor
 service
Simplify the 
loadTrack
 method
Maintain backward compatibility with existing track properties
The new implementation is more maintainable and follows the single responsibility principle.
To test these changes:

The app should now handle audio files and display basic metadata (title, artist, album) from either:
The track's properties
The filename (if in "Artist - Title" format)
Fallback to "Unknown" values
The cover art should still work if provided in the track's coverArt property.
